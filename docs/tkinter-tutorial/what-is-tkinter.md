# What is Tkinter?

[Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) is the standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) library for Python. It provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications. Tkinter comes bundled with Python, meaning you don't need to install any additional packages to start using it. It leverages the Tk GUI toolkit, which is cross-platform, making Tkinter applications compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Key features of Tkinter include:

- **Widgets**: A variety of widgets like buttons, labels, text boxes, and more for building interfaces.
- **Geometry managers**: Tools for organizing widgets in the application window.
- **Event handling**: Mechanisms to respond to user interactions such as clicks and keypresses.
- **Customization**: Options to customize the appearance and behavior of your GUI elements.

Whether you're building a simple utility or a more complex application, Tkinter provides the tools needed to bring your GUI to life.
