This template includes writing instructions and boilerplate text that you can customize, use as-is, or completely replace with your own text. This text is indicated in curly brackets. Make sure you replace the placeholders with your own text.

## Title

Write a short, descriptive title for the user story. For example, `Add to library button`.

## User story

Write a short description of the feature from the user’s perspective.

> As a user persona, I want to do some task so that I can achieve some goal.

## Acceptance criteria

List the outcomes the user should observe when interacting with the feature. All statements must be true to consider the user story complete.

* `Observable outcome 1`  
* `Observable outcome 2`  
* `Observable outcome n`

## Optional: Priority

Label the priority level for this user story.

You can designate priority levels using tags such as `Critical`, `High`, `Medium`, and `Low`.

## Optional: Story points
