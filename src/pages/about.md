# About

I help teams turn complex technical concepts into documentation that actually makes sense. My background spans integration platforms, open-source projects, and large-scale content migrations.

Currently, I create and maintain product documentation at Workato, where I collaborate closely with engineering and product teams to deliver accurate, actionable content for developers and business users.

## Core competencies

- **Documentation types**: Product documentation, API documentation, process documentation, user guides, conceptual documentation, technical how-tos
- **Technical skills**: Docs-as-code workflows, Markdown, Git/GitHub, HTML/CSS, REST APIs, Docusaurus, Vale, Visual Studio Code
- **Tools & platforms**: Confluence, Jira, Postman, Snagit, Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, Algolia, GitHub Actions
- **Style guides**: Google developer documentation style guide, Vale linting
